[3.323s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
[3.323s]   By not providing "Findnav2_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
[3.324s]   has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[3.324s]   "nav2_msgs", but CMake did not find one.
[3.324s] 
[3.324s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nav2_msgs" with
[3.324s]   any of the following names:
[3.324s] 
[3.324s]     nav2_msgsConfig.cmake
[3.324s]     nav2_msgs-config.cmake
[3.324s] 
[3.325s]   Add the installation prefix of "nav2_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[3.325s]   "nav2_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[3.325s]   "nav2_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[3.325s]   been installed.
