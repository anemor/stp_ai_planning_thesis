[3.424s]   By not providing "Findanafi_uav_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[3.424s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[3.425s]   "anafi_uav_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.
[3.425s] 
[3.425s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by
[3.425s]   "anafi_uav_interfaces" with any of the following names:

[3.425s] 
[3.425s]   Add the installation prefix of "anafi_uav_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
[3.425s]   or set "anafi_uav_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
[3.425s]   above files.  If "anafi_uav_interfaces" provides a separate development
[3.426s]   package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
