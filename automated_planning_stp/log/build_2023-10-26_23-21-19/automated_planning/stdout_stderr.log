CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findanafi_uav_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "anafi_uav_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "anafi_uav_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    anafi_uav_interfacesConfig.cmake
    anafi_uav_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "anafi_uav_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "anafi_uav_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "anafi_uav_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
